Max player count

ok, so the clients make up the first few clients in the packet list, while yhe bots are the last few.

Every client who receives the packets create these things, but the bots themsleves are indexed at the 
beginning of SceneGameplay, which should take about 0 milliseconds.

The movement and avatar controller functions must all be generic...
The "AI Avatar" doesn't actually need to decend from the entity class, it only needs to process AI algorithms,
and pass the output to the network.
